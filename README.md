# BadmintonReturnOptimizer
Find the best return one can give to the opponent in the game of badminton.

## How to run?
```sh
g++ main.cc
./a.out
```

## Motivation
I am taking a course on optimization and i wanted to get hands-on. I found badminton to be one area where i can improve my game by finding out the optimal position to return so that the opponent will find it very tough to return. I learnt badminton by playing on streets where the game is optimized for continuity(infinite game) i.e we return the shuttle to where the player is, but recently i started playing games where the game is optimized for winning(finite game) i.e we return the shuttle in a place where the player will find it tough to return.    

Also, i am new to C++. My hope is to pickup good practices along the way.
